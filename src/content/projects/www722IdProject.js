  standardName: 'AECT 2 – Content Pedagogy',
  standardSummary:
    'Candidates develop as reflective practitioners able to demonstrate effective implementation of educational technologies and processes based on contemporary content and pedagogy.',
  contextAndConditions:
    'During the Spring 2020 Design and Development Tools II (EDET 703) course with Dr. Gary Senn, we further developed our technical skills using current and emerging technologies to create a web-based project that included instructional and multimedia elements.',
  scope:
    'The goal of this assignment was to create a web-based version of the previously developed PowerPoint Prototype of Instructional Unit from EDET 722. After researching the biggest mistakes in webpage design, I focused on best practices for web delivery and created a series of webpages to present the EDET 722 instructional unit online.',
  role:
    'I completed this project by myself and served as the instructional designer and developer.',
  instructionalDesign:
    'Since this project was based on the instructional design work completed in EDET 722, I completed only a couple of the core elements from the ADDIE and MRK instructional design models, which included designing instructional strategies and the message and developing instructional delivery and evaluation instruments which were appropriate for web-based education.',

      title: 'Creating',
      indicator:
        'Candidates apply content pedagogy to create appropriate applications of processes and technologies to improve learning and performance outcomes.',
      implementation:
        'Expanding on previously created instructional content, I followed best practices for web delivery when creating the series of webpages.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Using',
      indicator:
        'Candidates implement appropriate educational technologies and processes based on appropriate content pedagogy.',
      implementation:
        'I used Google Sites and many of the platform’s features, such as collapsible text to format true/false questions.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Assessing/Evaluating',
      indicator:
        'Candidates demonstrate an inquiry process that assesses the adequacy of learning and evaluates the instruction and implementation of educational technologies and processes grounded in reflective practice.',
      implementation:
        'In order to assess learning, I used multiple choice and true/false questions which were aligned with learning objectives.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Managing',
      indicator:
        'Candidates manage appropriate technological processes and resources to provide supportive learning communities, create flexible and diverse learning environments, and develop and demonstrate appropriate content pedagogy.',
      implementation:
        'Similar to the PowerPoint version of the instructional unit, I created an interactive, web-based module which is self-paced in order to provide flexibility for the learner. Making the same content available in both formats (PowerPoint and web-based) creates different learning environments to best meet the diverse needs of the learners.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Ethics',
      indicator:
        'Candidates design and select media, technology, and processes that emphasize the diversity of our society as a multicultural community.',
      implementation:
        'In order to accommodate a diverse group of learners, the series of webpages are designed with user-friendly navigation and simple layout with limited text, subheadings and bulleted lists.',
    },
  ],
  reflection:
    'Since I was already familiar with Google Sites platform from previous courses, this artifact demonstrates more advanced application of knowledge and skills. I was able to focus fully on creating the web delivery, since the content was already developed previously in the EDET 722 course. For this project, I continually referred back to common mistakes in web page design (another assignment in the course) in order to make sure that I was following best practices when creating the series of webpages, which included eliminating some non-essential text and images for a more clean and simple design.',
