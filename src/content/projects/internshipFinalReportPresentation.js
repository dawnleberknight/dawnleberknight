  standardName: 'AECT 4 – Professional Knowledge and Skills',
  standardSummary:
    'Candidates design, develop, implement, and evaluate technology-rich learning environments within a supportive community of practice.',
  contextAndConditions:
    'During the Fall 2020 Internship in Educational Technology (EDET 650) course with Dr. Michael Grant, I submitted my field-based experience (which took place earlier in November 2019-March 2020) in the design, development, evaluation, and implementation of technology-based instructional and training projects.',
  scope:
    'Although my internship took place with my current employer, South Carolina Area Health Education Consortium (SC AHEC), the project involved work outside my typical scope of practice and allowed me to work with regional AHEC centers, who are private not-for-profit 501(c)3 organizations. I applied my M.Ed. program learning through community service with the development of 20 one-hour online modules, which were designed to develop academically proficient and self-confident future healthcare professionals.',
  role:
    'As a former middle/high school teacher with years of experience in healthcare administration, I served as one of the subject matter experts and collaborated with other subject matter experts, which were the Health Careers Program (HCP) Coordinators throughout South Carolina. In addition, I served as the instructional designer and developer for the online modules.',
  instructionalDesign:
    'Following ADDIE and MRK instructional design models, I worked with fellow SMEs to analyze content that would be helpful for our target audience, which included determining instructional problems, identifying learner characteristics, and analyzing task components. We then designed each of the one-hour online modules, which included defining instructional objectives, structuring content sequentially, designing instructional strategies, and planning the instructional message and mode of delivery. Then I developed the instructional materials in the SC AHEC learning management system, Moodle, and fellow SMEs reviewed the modules to provide feedback. Once improvements were made to each module, it was implemented and made available for high school students to self-register for each module.',

      title: 'Collaborative Practice',
      indicator:
        'Candidates collaborate with their peers and subject matter experts to analyze learners, develop and design instruction, and evaluate its impact on learners.',
      implementation:
        'In each step of the process (as seen in the Job Aid artifact), I collaborated with other subject matter experts, primarily HCP Coordinators throughout the state, along with the Director of HCP and Director of Communications and Marketing.',

      title: 'Leadership',
      indicator:
        'Candidates lead their peers in designing and implementing technology-supported learning.',
      implementation:
        'Prior to this project, HCP Coordinators had primarily delivered in-person instruction to high school students so I led several brief training sessions to discuss how to effectively transition face-to-face instruction to the online learning environment.',

    {
      title: 'Reflection on Practice',
      indicator:
        'Candidates analyze and interpret data and artifacts and reflect on the effectiveness of the design, development and implementation of technology-supported instruction and learning to enhance their professional growth.',
      implementation:
        'During the project, I compiled data and created summative evaluation report to measure the degree to which the learning objectives were attained by the end of the “HIPAA Primer” instructional module and to assess reactions toward the module. The most significant and encouraging finding was that 60% of learners strongly agreed/agreed that completion of the module increased their desire to work in a health-related career, which is a primary goal of the project.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Assessing/Evaluating',
      indicator:
        'Candidates design and implement assessment and evaluation plans that align with learning goals and instructional activities.',
      implementation:
        'For each online module, I developed at least one assignment, 10-question pre/post tests, and a course evaluation which are all directly related to the learning objectives.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Ethics',
      indicator:
        'Candidates demonstrate ethical behavior within the applicable cultural context during all aspects of their work and with respect for the diversity of learners in each setting.',
      implementation:
        'Since the target audience for the online modules are high school students across the state, the instructional materials such as videos and pictures demonstrate diversity. In addition, closed-captioning was made available on all videos to accommodate diverse learning preferences and abilities.',
    },
  ],
  reflection:
    'During this project, I served as the expert in instructional design for the online modules and appreciated the opportunity to directly apply what I was learning in the M.Ed. program. As discussed in my Internship Final Report Presentation artifact, I learned valuable lessons on managing a project effectively, utilizing existing resources, and embracing opportunities for improvement.',
